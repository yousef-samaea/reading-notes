# Unity

Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple 
Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X game engine. The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of 
desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms. It is particularly popular for iOS and Android mobile game development 
and is considered easy to use for beginner developers and is popular for indie game development.

The engine can be used to create three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) games, as well as interactive simulations and 
other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, 
engineering, construction, and the United States Armed Forces.

Unity gives users the ability to create games and experiences in both 2D and 3D, and the engine offers a primary scripting API in 
C# using Mono, for both the Unity editor in the form of plugins, and games themselves, as well as drag and drop functionality. 
Prior to C# being the primary programming language used for the engine, it previously supported Boo, which was removed with the 
release of Unity 5, and a Boo-based implementation of JavaScript called UnityScript, which was deprecated in August 2017, after 
the release of Unity 2017.1, in favor of C#.

Within 2D games, Unity allows importation of sprites and an advanced 2D world renderer. For 3D games, Unity allows specification 
of texture compression, mipmaps, and resolution settings for each platform that the game engine supports, and provides support 
for bump mapping, reflection mapping, parallax mapping, screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO), dynamic shadows using shadow maps, 
render-to-texture and full-screen post-processing effects.

Two separate render pipelines are available, High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) and Universal Render Pipeline (URP), in 
addition to the legacy built-in pipeline.[non-primary source needed] All three render pipelines are incompatible with each other.
 Unity offers a tool to upgrade shaders using the legacy renderer to URP or HDRP.
