# Open-Source Software Contribution

### Getting started with contributing to open source

It can be intimidating to start contributing to an open source project. But with a little research and planning, you can be a.
valuable part of your favorite open source software.

Contributing to open source can be intimidating and confusing depending on the project you’re working on. To add to that, most
large open source projects have a steep learning curve. However, as evidenced by how widespread open source is, there are a lot
of opportunities to break into it and thrive even if you’re new.

Open source refers to source code that is made available to the public to view, use, modify, and distribute under a license. It’s
usually developed and maintained collaboratively by a community of its users. Some well-known open source projects include
Django, Postgres, MongoDB, Vue, Go, Ruby, TypeScript, Git and so many more.

Although the main point of  open source projects is to create valuable and accessible open source software, individual
contributors can get plenty of personal benefit from contributing to them. You help maintain the software you use while honing
your technical skills. When you’re applying for jobs, you can point to your work on open source software as proof of your skills.

By collaborating with others on open source you use, you get to become part of a community where you can practice your soft
skills like communication, giving and receiving feedback, emotional intelligence, etc. These communities also introduce you to
tons of people you can network with, who in turn will open you up to worthwhile opportunities.

Below, we’ll explore some strategies that you could use to break into open source. For illustration purposes (and because I’ve
contributed some there), I’ll use the Angular project to explain how you could contribute to open source software. Although most
of the examples will be of the Angular project, all these strategies described apply to many open source projects.

### Ways to contribute to open source

There are a lot of ways you can participate in open source. As a beginner, you could identify and fix bugs in a project. For
example, the Angular project accepts issues pointing out bugs and even pull requests that fix them. In these projects, you can
propose, help design, and work on new features. Angular for instance accepts proposals for large features and pull requests for
smaller features. Larger features will require greater community involvement, and some communities require you to earn a
reputation fixing bugs before moving to feature development.

Your contributions do not have to be exclusive to code. You can help a project by making comments on existing code and APIs to
add context and writing documentation for the project. As an example, Angular has two whole projects on Github dedicated to
documentation

### Understanding how a project works

Not all open source projects operate in the same way. Some allow contributions from anyone. Some require you to work your way up to get contribution privileges. Some have multiple people involved in managing a project. Others have a single person in charge, a so-called benevolent dictator for life.

Contribution guidelines help you understand how to approach your participation in a project. It will explain how to reach out
about a contribution, provide templates for communicating bugs and suggesting features, list work that is needed by maintainers,
project goals, etc. An amazing example is the Angular contribution guide which lists all kinds of useful information for new
 contributors like their commit message guidelines, coding rules, submission guidelines, etc. in great detail.

In addition to contribution guidelines, some projects will have a code of conduct. It usually outlines community rules and
behavior expectations. It’s meant to help you know how to be a amiable and professional contributor and community member.
Angular, for instance, has an awesome code of conduct that lists what they consider unprofessional conduct, their
responsibilities to the community, and how to get in contact in case someone violates it.

Big projects may have governance policy and team documents that outline specific roles in the community, teams, sub-committees,
contribution workflows, how discussions are conducted, and who gets to commit. These kinds of documents are essential to
understanding how the community operates. The about page on angular.io, for example, lists who all the core team members are,
their roles, and other contributors. On Github, they also have a docs folder containing policies regarding contribution.  

An open source project is sort of like a project at any company you might work at; there will be a house coding style, team
culture, and workflows for getting things done. The difference is that open source projects can and will have a much different
group of people working on them.

### Finding projects to work on

One way to find projects to work on is to look to open source software you use often and like. Is there a tool, package,
framework, or a language that you work with regularly and enjoy using? Find out whether it’s an open source project by checking
its license and if it accepts contributions and is active. Working on things you already use gives you an edge when contributing
because you’re already pretty familiar with how it works and have experience using it. As a bonus, you can address problems that
have been bothering you or suggest features that you want in the software. If you are going to contribute code to the project, be
sure you can work in the language it’s written in.

If the above approach may not work for you, try using the Github explore page to find projects that are accepting contributions
or actively want help. Github suggests projects you may like based on people and repositories you follow, star, and watch.
Another way to find projects is to use Github’s search tool by entering beginner-friendly contribution tags like
good-first-issue, good-first-bug, beginner-friendly, easy, low-hanging-fruit, first-timers-only, etc. Filter search results to
return issues in open states and in the languages you’d like to work in. There are tons of other tools, platforms, and programs
where you could find open source projects that I’ll list at the end of this article to help you with your search.

### Picking issues to work on and making contributions

Projects may list the work that needs to be done in task, bug, and issue trackers. For example, Angular uses Github’s
projectmanagement feature to outline and assign tasks and track their progress. If a project has one, get access to it.

As a rule of thumb, start with the easiest and smallest contributions first that take the least amount of work to build up your
confidence and credibility before trying harder contributions. Writing documentation and fixing typos is a good place to begin.
Look for issues that are tagged for beginners with the tags mentioned earlier.

After you pick a task you think you can finish, do your research. Read documentation, code, and discussions related to the task
to get a better understanding of what to do. If you’re stuck on something even after you’ve researched it, reach out to the
community and ask for help, clarification, or mentorship. However, make sure that you discuss issues related to the task publicly
 so that the rest of the community can benefit from what you learn. For example, discuss an issue publicly on Github versus in a
 private direct message on Slack. Once you feel like you have enough context on a task and know how to go about it, write some
 code and submit a PR. Github has a great checklist about what to check for before you contribute to a project so your effort is
 not wasted.

### Submitting your work

After you’ve completed work on your contribution, submit it as per the contribution guidelines. At times, your submission may not
get a reply even after a reasonable amount of time has gone by. In such cases, respectfully request a review or get in touch with
other contributors for assistance. Post-review changes may be requested. Try to make them as soon as possible so that your
contribution is integrated promptly and does not become out-of-date or forgotten. If your contribution is rejected, ask for
feedback to understand why. When reviewers ask questions, make comments, or give feedback, be responsive and check on your work
for any updates regularly. Treat this like any other work and be professional, courteous, and respectful.
