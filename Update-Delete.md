# Client/server architecture

At it's most basic, the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.

## On the client side: defining how to send the data

The `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are `action` and `method`.

The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form â€” the current page.

`<form action="https://example.com">`

`<form action="/somewhere_else">`

The names and values of the non-file form controls are sent to the server as name=value pairs joined with ampersands. The action value should be a file on the server that can handle the incoming data, including ensuring server-side validation. The server then responds, generally handling the data and loading the URL defined by the action attribute, causing a new page load (or a refresh of the existing page, if the action points to the same page).

How the data is sent depends on the method attribute.

The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method

To understand the difference between those two methods, let's step back and examine how HTTP works. Each time you want to reach a resource on the Web, the browser sends a request to a URL. An HTTP request consists of two parts: a header that contains a set of global metadata about the browser's capabilities, and a body that can contain information necessary for the server to process the specific request.


## The GET method

The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.

Consider the following form:

`<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">`
  `<div>`
    `<label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>`
    `<input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">`
  `</div>`
  `<div>`
    `<label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>`
    `<input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">`
  `</div>`
  `<div>`
    `<button>Send my greetings</button>`
 ` </div>`
`</form>`

## On the server side: retrieving the data
The web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client, like a web browser, sends a request to a server like Apache or Nginx, using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

Whichever HTTP method you choose, the server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs. The way you access this list depends on the development platform you use and on any specific frameworks you may be using with it
