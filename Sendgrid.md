Sending Email with Microsoft Azure

 helps you integrate their durable service with less effort.

### SendGrid Benefits

It provides 24/7 customer support. It also has click tracking mechanism, Spam Reports, and if your mail gets bounced back, 
SenGrid tracks that as well. You can set daily/monthly mailing functionality over SendGrid API just to track how many emails went 
well or bounced back. If ever SendGrid API is down, it puts those emails in queues and sends it again once it is up So it works
