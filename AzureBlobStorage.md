# Azure Blob Storage

One of the main services provided with Azure is Cloud Storage. This allows us to store different artifacts in the Cloud. These 
include Tables, Queues, Files, and Containers. Containers are used to store Blobs which can be any type of file including text 
files, image files, video files, etc. You can read more about the different types of Blobs on the web.

### Different Azure Storage Service
1. Azure Blob - also known as blobs which are mainly used to store the binary/text data such as photos, videos, documents, etc.
2. Azure Tables - which is nothing but a NoSQL storage for schemaless structured data.
3. Azure Queue - it is used to store the messages which can be used to communicate with applications
4. Azure Files - it is managed file share service for cloud or on-premise using SMB/NFS protocol.
5. Azure Disks - It is a virtual hard disk (VHD) that is of two types: managed and unmanaged.

Azure Blob storage is a storage service used to store schema-less structured data in the cloud. We can store data such as 
documents, pictures, videos, log files, backup files which donâ€™t have a fixed structure. Blob storage is similar to directory 
structure where we can create different containers to store the blobs.

### About Blob storage:
Blob storage is designed for:

1. Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
2. Storing files for distributed access.
3. Streaming video and audio.
4. Writing to log files.
5. Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
6. Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

There are 3 types of Blobs:

1. Block Blobs - which are used to store the text/binary data.
2. Append Blobs - nothing but block blobs that are optimized for append operation.
3. Page Blobs - which store random access files up to 8 TiB in size.
