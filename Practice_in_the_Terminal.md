# The Command Line

i did know there is a lot of commands i didn't notice before that will make using the terminal mach easier such as: 
* ls -a
List the contents of a directory, including hidden files. * which basically will show me the hidden files,
* and rmdir Remove Directory * it's really helpful because i didn't know how to remove the olds ones,
and much more cool commands that will make my life easier
