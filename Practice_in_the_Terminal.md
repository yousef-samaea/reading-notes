# The Command Line

the terminal may look scary but when i use to it it was a very good helper using it i can create directories, coping repositories, and push my work using github commands and The Shell, Bash.


### i did know there is a lot of commands i didn't notice before that will make using the terminal mach easier such as: 
pwd: Print Working Directory, witch basically give me the full path of the file in working at.

ls: What's in Our Current Location.

 ls -a : List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.  which basically will show me the hidden files,
 and rmdir.
 
 Remove Directory  it's really helpful because i didn't know how to remove the olds ones,
and much more cool commands that will make my life easier.

Paths or roots: It is denoted by a single slash ( / ). It has subdirectories, they have subdirectories and so on.

cd [location] : using it will open the file or the dairictory.

### Linux is an Extensionless System
Linux uses some Extensionless, The following are common extensions:
1. file.exe - an executable file, or program.
2. file.txt - a plain text file.
3. file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.

and always i sholde remember that Linux is Case Sensitive, Spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid.
