**What is a growth mindset?**

A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.
This concept struck a chord with me because I discovered that when I try things, I often get only so far before encountering a challenge and stopping. Behaving this way is all well and good when it comes to rock climbing, or judo, or kite surfing (a few of many activities I’ve failed to master), but when it comes to my work, it’s a problem.

**Growing at work, and outside work too**

I’ve been guilty of having a fixed mindset far too often, and I’m working to change that. Things like wisdom and achievement are the products of putting in hard work, not avoiding it. We live in a society where the instant gratification monkey sits on everyone’s shoulder. But the pleasures that result from determination and hard work far outweigh anything that devilish chimp has to offer. The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective.

Maybe all this seems obvious to you, in which case, you’re lucky. For me, I’ve found that taking the time to assess what I’m doing is tremendously effective in keeping me on track at work. When I feel myself losing focus, I try to remember that short-term frustration will likely result in long-term improvement of my abilities – if I just stay with it. A growth mindset opens me up to more creativity and possibility, and I discover I’m able to achieve more and set higher goals.

**Basic writing and formatting syntax**

Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.
Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading
Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
Rendered inline code block

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.
Lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson
Rendered unordered list

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams
Rendered ordered list

Nested Lists
You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Atom, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.

1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item
