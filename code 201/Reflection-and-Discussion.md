 A header or footer for anindividual <article> or<section> within the page.
*Navigation<nav>*
The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
*Articles*
The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

*Who is the Site For* Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve
It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.

How Of ten People Will Visit Your Site
Some sites benefit from being updated morefrequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while
other content remains relatively static.
*Site Maps*
Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.
